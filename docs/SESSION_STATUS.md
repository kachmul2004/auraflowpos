# Current Session Status

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** In Progress - Database Implementation  
**Last Action:** Adding Okio for file-based persistence

---

## ✅ Completed This Session

### **1. Orders & Parked Sales Features**

- ✅ Complete implementation with mock data
- ✅ InMemoryLocalStorage with JSON serialization
- ✅ Reactive StateFlow architecture
- ✅ Full UI integration
- ✅ Build successful

### **2. Database Planning**

- ✅ Comprehensive database implementation plan created
- ✅ Okio dependency added to gradle
- ✅ FileLocalStorage skeleton created
- ⏳ Okio import sync in progress

---

## 🔧 Current Technical Issue

**Problem:** Okio dependency not fully synced in IDE

- Okio 3.9.1 added to gradle ✅
- FileLocalStorage created ✅
- Import errors due to sync issue ⏳

**Solution Options:**

1. **Restart IDE** - Let IntelliJ/Android Studio fully sync
2. **Invalidate Caches** - Force dependency reload
3. **Wait for sync** - Gradle is downloading dependencies

---

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

### **Option A: Fix Okio Imports (15 minutes)**

1. Restart IDE / Invalidate caches
2. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
3. Verify Okio imports work
4. Implement platform-specific storage paths (expect/actual)
5. Test file persistence

### **Option B: Use Current InMemory (Keep as-is)**

1. Document that data is in-memory for development
2. Add Okio file storage in next session
3. Continue with other features

---

## 🎯 What's Working Right Now

**All features are functional with in-memory storage:**

✅ **Parked Sales:**

- Park current cart
- View all parked sales
- Load parked sale
- Delete parked sale
- Real-time updates

✅ **Orders:**

- Create orders from checkout
- View order history
- Order details with items
- Status badges
- Payment info

✅ **Mock Data:**

- Products (hardcoded)
- Customers (mock)
- Authentication (mock tokens)

**Limitation:** Data is lost on app restart (expected for in-memory storage)

---

## 🚀 Recommended Path Forward

### **Short Term (This Week):**

1. ✅ Keep InMemoryLocalStorage for development
2. ⏳ Fix Okio in next session (IDE restart)
3. ⏳ Implement FileLocalStorage with platform paths
4. ⏳ Test persistence across app restarts

### **Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks):**

1. ⏳ Add Room database for Android
2. ⏳ SQLDelight for full KMP if needed
3. ⏳ Implement proper DAOs and entities
4. ⏳ Add database migrations

### **Long Term (Month 1-2):**

1. ⏳ Server API integration
2. ⏳ Offline-first sync strategy
3. ⏳ WebSocket real-time updates
4. ⏳ Conflict resolution

## 📊 Progress Summary

| Feature | Status | Persistence | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Products | ✅ Working | Hardcoded | Mock data |
| Cart | ✅ Working | In-memory | Cleared on checkout |
| Parked Sales | ✅ Working | In-memory | Need file/DB |
| Orders | ✅ Working | In-memory | Need file/DB |
| Customers | ✅ Working | Mock | Need DB |
| Auth | ✅ Working | In-memory | Need secure storage |

---

## 🔨 Build Status

**Last Build:** ⚠️ Partial (Okio sync issue)

```bash
# Shared module compiles with InMemoryLocalStorage
✅ :shared:build (with InMemoryLocalStorage)

# FileLocalStorage has import errors (sync issue)
⏳ Okio imports pending IDE sync
```

**To Fix:**

1. Restart Android Studio / IntelliJ
2. File → Invalidate Caches → Restart
3. Wait for Gradle sync
4. Build should pass

---

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

1. **LocalStorage Abstraction** ✅
    - Clean interface for easy swapping
    - InMemoryLocalStorage → FileLocalStorage → Room
    - No changes needed in repositories

2. **Okio for File Storage** ✅
    - Battle-tested, mature library
    - Full KMP support
    - Simple API
    - Zero build complexity

3. **Room for Production** 📋
    - Will add when KMP support is stable
    - Android-first, then expand
    - Type-safe, reactive queries

4. **Offline-First Architecture** 🎯
    - Save locally first, always
    - Sync to server when online
    - Background sync workers
    - Conflict resolution

---

## 📝 Code Quality

✅ **What's Good:**

- Clean Architecture principles
- Reactive StateFlow
- Proper dependency injection
- Comprehensive documentation
- Zero compilation errors (with InMemoryLocalStorage)

⏳ **What Needs Work:**

- File persistence (Okio sync)
- Platform-specific paths (expect/actual)
- Database setup (Room/SQLDelight)
- Server API integration

---

## 🎉 Summary

**Current State:** Fully functional POS app with in-memory mock data

**Achievements:**

- Complete Orders feature
- Complete Parked Sales feature
- Reactive architecture
- Clean code structure
- Comprehensive documentation

**Next Session Goals:**

1. Fix Okio imports (restart IDE)
2. Implement FileLocalStorage
3. Add platform-specific storage paths
4. Test persistence across restarts

**Everything works! We just need to add file persistence in the next session.** 🚀

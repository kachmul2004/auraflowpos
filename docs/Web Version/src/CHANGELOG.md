### Fixed - Admin Navigation from POS (January 14, 2025)

#### Issue
When navigating to admin from the POS screen while having an active shift, the clock out process would complete successfully and show a "Clocked out successfully" toast message, but the screen would remain on the POS view instead of navigating to the admin login screen.

#### Root Causes
1. **ShiftDialog callback issue**: The `onClockOut` callback was only being called when a Z-Report was successfully generated (`if (report && onClockOut)`). If `generateZReport()` returned `null`, the callback would never fire, so navigation would never happen.

2. **Intent preservation**: The `clockOutIntent` state (which tracks whether user wants to go to 'admin' or 'logout') was being reset prematurely in some flows.

#### Solution
Fixed the navigation flow with two critical changes:

1. **ShiftDialog.tsx**: Always call `onClockOut` callback, even when report is `null`
   - Changed from `if (report && onClockOut)` to `if (onClockOut)`
   - This ensures navigation happens regardless of Z-Report generation status

2. **POSView.tsx**: Improved intent handling
   - When Z-Report is generated: Wait for Z-Report to close before navigating (intent preserved)
   - When no Z-Report: Navigate immediately based on intent
   - Removed premature intent reset in Z-Report's `onClose` callback
   - Let `onAfterClose` callback handle the navigation after Z-Report is dismissed

#### Files Modified
- `/components/ShiftDialog.tsx`: Always call `onClockOut` callback
- `/components/POSView.tsx`: Fixed `onClockOut` and `onClose` handlers to properly preserve and use `clockOutIntent`

#### User Impact
Users can now successfully navigate to admin dashboard after clocking out from an active shift. The flow works correctly in all scenarios:
- ✅ With Z-Report generation → shows report → navigates after closing
- ✅ Without Z-Report generation → navigates immediately
- ✅ Both admin navigation and logout flows work correctly

### Fixed - Critical Admin Module Bugs (January 13, 2025)

#### getAllTransactions Function Enhancement
- **Issue**: Previously only returned transactions from current shift
- **Solution**: Now aggregates transactions from ALL shifts (current + completed)
- **Impact**: Admin Transactions module now shows complete transaction history
- **Performance**: Results sorted by timestamp (newest first) for better UX

#### Transaction Type Naming Consistency
- **Issue**: Mismatch between Transaction type interface (camelCase) and component usage (kebab-case)
  - Interface defined: `'cashIn'`, `'cashOut'`, `'noSale'`
  - Components were checking: `'cash-in'`, `'cash-out'`
- **Solution**: Standardized all components to use camelCase matching the type interface
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - TransactionsModule.tsx (badges, icons, filters)
  - ShiftsModule.tsx (transaction type filtering)
- **Added**: Missing transaction types (noSale, exchange) to badges and icons

#### ShiftsModule Terminal Access Bug
- **Issue**: Accessing non-existent `selectedShift.terminalId` property
- **Solution**: Fixed to use correct `selectedShift.terminal` object property
- **Impact**: Shift details dialog now displays terminal information correctly

### Fixed - Transactions Module Error

**Issue**: TransactionsModule was trying to access `state.transactions` which didn't exist in the store.

**Solution**:
- Added `getAllTransactions()` getter to store that returns transactions from current shift
- Added `users` array to store (imported from mockUsers)
- Updated TransactionsModule to use the new getter
- Transactions are now properly retrieved from `currentShift.transactions`

**Technical Details**:
- Transactions are stored per-shift, not globally
- `getAllTransactions()` returns current shift's transactions or empty array
- Added mockUsers to store exports for user lookups in admin modules

### Added - Inventory Management for Product Variations

#### Variation Stock Adjustments
- **Expandable Product Rows**: Products with variations now show expand/collapse controls
- **Variation Details**: See stock levels for each individual variation (size, color, etc.)
- **Individual Adjustments**: Adjust stock for specific variations independently
- **Variation Info Display**: Shows SKU, price, and current stock for each variation
- **Visual Indicators**: Low stock warnings for both products and variations
- **Enhanced Dialog**: Stock adjustment dialog shows which variation is being adjusted
- **Improved UI**: Custom table layout replaces generic DataTable for better variation support

**Use Case**: Adjust stock for "Coffee - Large" separately from "Coffee - Small", track each variation's inventory independently.

### Fixed - Clock Out Button & Industry-Based Categories

#### Clock Out Button Issue Resolved
- **Fixed Shift Dialog**: Removed invalid `shift` prop from ActionBar's ShiftDialog component
- **Clock Out Button Now Shows**: "Clock Out" button properly appears in shift dialog when opened from ActionBar
- **Proper Data Flow**: ShiftDialog correctly gets currentShift from store instead of via props

#### Industry-Based Category System
- **Removed Color Property**: Eliminated color picker from category management app-wide
- **Added Industry Field**: Categories now have an optional `industry` field (restaurant, retail, grocery, pharmacy, furniture, general)
- **Industry Filtering**: Categories automatically filter based on selected POS industry type
- **Universal Categories**: Categories without industry field show in all industries
- **Cashier Side Filtering**: Product grid and mobile category filter show only relevant categories for current industry
- **Admin Category Management**: Category dialog now has industry dropdown instead of color picker
- **Updated Mock Data**: Added industry-specific categories for all 6 industry types

**Example**: When POS is set to "Pharmacy", only pharmacy categories (Medications, Wellness, etc.) and universal categories appear on cashier side.

### Changed - Product Edit Page (UX Improvement)

#### Converted Product Editing from Modal to Full Page
- **Dedicated Edit Page**: Product create/edit now uses a full-page interface instead of a modal dialog
- **Better UX**: More space for variations management and form fields
- **Card-Based Layout**: Organized into sections: Basic Information, Pricing & Inventory, Product Options, and Variations
- **Navigation**: Clean navigation with back button and sticky header with save/cancel actions
- **Responsive Design**: Scrollable content area with better mobile support
- **Improved Workflow**: Users click "Add Product" or edit icon to navigate to dedicated page

### Fixed - Product Variation Management

#### Admin Product Editor Enhancement
- **Variation Management UI**: Added comprehensive interface to create/edit product variations in Admin Products Module
- **Variation Type Support**: Define variation type (Size, Color, Style, etc.) for each product
- **Multiple Variations**: Add unlimited variations with individual names, prices, SKUs, and stock levels

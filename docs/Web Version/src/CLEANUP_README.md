# ðŸ§¹ Project Cleanup - README

## Quick Start

### Option 1: One Command (Easiest) âš¡

```bash
bash RUN_CLEANUP_NOW.sh
```

That's it! The script will:
- âœ… Move all docs to proper subdirectories
- âœ… Archive outdated files
- âœ… Delete unused code
- âœ… Verify the structure
- âœ… Clean up after itself

**Time**: 30 seconds

---

### Option 2: Manual Commands

If you prefer to run commands manually, see `CLEANUP_EXECUTION.md`.

---

## What Gets Cleaned Up

### Documentation (20 files)
- **Move**: 8 docs from `/docs` to subdirectories
- **Archive**: 12 outdated docs from root to `/docs/archive`

### Code (1 file)
- **Delete**: `PaymentDialog.tsx` (unused, replaced)

### Links (2 files)

  - README.md
  - industries/bar/FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION.md

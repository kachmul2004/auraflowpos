# Multi-Subscription Architecture Guide

## Overview

AuraFlow-POS now supports **multiple active subscriptions** allowing businesses to combine different industry packages (e.g., Restaurant + Bar + Retail) in a **unified interface**. All products and features from subscribed packages are available simultaneously.

## Architecture

### Subscription System

Businesses can subscribe to multiple industry packages:
- `restaurant` - Full-service restaurants with table management
- `bar` - Bars & nightclubs with age verification and tabs
- `cafe` - Coffee shops and quick-service cafes
- `retail` - General retail stores
- `pharmacy` - Pharmacies with prescription tracking
- `salon` - Salons and spas with appointments
- `ultimate` - All-in-one package with every feature

### Unified Product Display

When a business has multiple subscriptions, **ALL products from all subscribed presets are shown in one unified grid**:

```typescript
// Store state
subscribedPresets: ['restaurant', 'bar'] // Multiple active subscriptions

// UI shows BOTH restaurant AND bar categories:
// - Appetizers, Entrees, Desserts (from restaurant)
// - Beer, Wine, Cocktails, Spirits (from bar)
// All in the same product grid!
```

### Quick Bar Mode (Optional)

For high-speed bar service, businesses can optionally enable **Quick Bar Mode** - a specialized layout optimized for rapid drink ordering:

```typescript
quickBarMode: false // Default: unified grid
quickBarMode: true  // Optional: bar-optimized layout
```

**Important:** Quick Bar Mode is an OPTIONAL specialized view, not the default. It's designed for busy bar service periods when speed is critical.

## Bar & Nightclub Order Types

When the bar preset is active (`activePresetView === 'bar'`), the following custom order types are available:

### Order Types Configuration

From `/presets/bar.preset.ts`:

```typescript
types: [
  { id: 'bar', label: 'Bar', icon: 'üç∫' },
  { id: 'table', label: 'Table Service', icon: 'üçΩÔ∏è' },
  { id: 'bottle-service', label: 'Bottle Service', icon: 'üçæ' },
  { id: 'to-go', label: 'To-Go', icon: 'ü•§' },
]
```

## Real-World Example

### Restaurant + Bar Combo

A business that operates both a restaurant and bar subscribes to both packages:

```typescript
subscribedPresets: ['restaurant', 'bar']
```

**What the cashier sees:**
- **Product Grid** shows ALL categories:
  - üçΩÔ∏è Appetizers, Entrees, Desserts (restaurant)
  - üç∫ Beer, Wine, Cocktails, Spirits (bar)
  - üçî Food (bar snacks)
- **Order Types** include both:
  - Dine-In, Takeout (restaurant)
  - Bar Service, Bottle Service (bar)
- **Features** from both presets:
  - Table management (restaurant)
  - Age verification (bar)
  - Open tabs (bar)

**Workflow:**
1. Customer orders a burger (restaurant category)
2. Same order, add a beer (bar category)
3. One unified cart, one checkout
4. Age verification automatically triggered for alcohol
5. Order can be for Dine-In (restaurant) or Bar Service (bar)

### Quick Bar Mode Toggle

During busy bar hours, toggle Quick Bar Mode for rapid drink ordering:

```typescript
// Toggle quick bar mode
setQuickBarMode(true);

// UI switches to bar-optimized layout
{quickBarMode && subscribedPresets.includes('bar') ? (
  <BarProductArea /> // Fast drink ordering interface
) : (
  <ProductGrid /> // Unified product grid
)}
```

**Quick Bar Mode UI:**
- Quick Order view with drink shortcuts
- Open Tabs management
- Section/table selection
- QuickDrinkBuilder for custom drinks

### Checking Feature Access

```typescript
// Check if business has access to a specific preset
const hasBarAccess = subscribedPresets.includes('bar');

// Show Quick Bar Mode toggle only if bar subscription active
{hasBarAccess && (
  <Button onClick={() => setQuickBarMode(!quickBarMode)}>
    Quick Bar Mode
  </Button>
)}
```

## Admin Configuration

### Setting Subscriptions

Admins can configure which packages the business has subscribed to:

```typescript
// Example: Restaurant + Bar combo
setSubscribedPresets(['restaurant', 'bar']);
```

### Default View

The system defaults to the first subscribed preset:
```typescript
activePresetView: subscribedPresets[0] // 'restaurant'
```

Users can then switch to other views using the dropdown.

## Database Schema

### Subscriptions Table (Future Implementation)

```sql
CREATE TABLE business_subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  business_id UUID REFERENCES businesses(id),
  preset_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  started_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### View Preferences Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_view_preferences (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  default_preset_view TEXT,
  last_used_preset_view TEXT,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Benefits

### For Multi-Service Businesses

A business that operates both a restaurant and a bar can:
1. **Add any items to the same order** - Mix food and drinks seamlessly
2. **No view switching needed** - All products visible in one grid
3. **Combined categories** - Restaurant + Bar categories shown together
4. **Unified workflow** - One checkout process for everything
5. **Optional specialization** - Toggle Quick Bar Mode during busy bar service

### Clean UI

- **Unified product grid** - All subscribed categories in one place
- **Smart category filtering** - Only shows categories from subscribed presets
- **Subscription badges** - Visual indicators (üçΩÔ∏è üç∫) show active packages
- **Optional quick modes** - Specialized layouts available when needed

### Scalability

- Easy to add new industry presets
- Businesses can upgrade by adding subscriptions
- Downgrade by removing subscriptions
- Pay only for what you use

## Migration Notes

### From Single Profile

Existing businesses with `businessProfile: 'restaurant'` will:
1. Have `subscribedPresets: ['restaurant']` set
2. See only restaurant categories in product grid
3. Quick Bar Mode toggle hidden (no bar subscription)
4. Can upgrade to add more subscriptions

### Adding Bar to Existing Restaurant

```typescript
// Before
subscribedPresets: ['restaurant']
// Shows: Appetizers, Entrees, Desserts, Beverages

// After adding bar subscription
subscribedPresets: ['restaurant', 'bar']
// Shows: Appetizers, Entrees, Desserts, Beverages, Beer, Wine, Cocktails, Spirits, Food
// Plus: Quick Bar Mode toggle button appears
```

**UI Changes:**
- Product grid automatically shows new bar categories
- Quick Bar Mode toggle appears in header
- Subscription badges show both üçΩÔ∏è and üç∫
- Age verification feature activates
- Open tabs feature becomes available

- PROJECT_STATUS.md - Current status ✅
- CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution guide ✅
- CHANGELOG.md - Version history ✅
- LICENSE - License file ✅

### Current Work

## Recommendation

**Keep the archive for now** but consider:
1. Moving to `/docs/archive/` subdirectory
2. Creating a single `DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md` that summarizes all phases
3. Keeping only the most relevant archived files

This makes the root directory cleaner while preserving development history.

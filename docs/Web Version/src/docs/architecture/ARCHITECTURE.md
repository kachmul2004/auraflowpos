```

### Component Guidelines
- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript for type safety
- Props validation with TypeScript interfaces
- Error boundaries for resilience
- Accessibility-first design (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### State Management Guidelines
- Keep state as close to where it's needed as possible
- Use Zustand for global state
- Use React state for component-local state
- Avoid prop drilling with context when needed

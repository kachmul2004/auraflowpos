## 📚 After Moving Files

Your docs will be perfectly organized:

```
docs/
├── README.md                          # Your navigation hub
├── architecture/                      # System design
├── getting-started/                   # Quick setup
├── guides/                            # User & dev guides
├── integrations/                      # API & hardware
└── planning/                          # Roadmap
```

## 🎯 Then What?

### Option 1: Backend Setup (Recommended - 45 min)
**In your separate environment:**
1. `npm install @supabase/supabase-js dexie`
2. Follow `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
3. Get production backend running!

### Option 2: Review & Plan
1. Read `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - See what's done
2. Read `docs/planning/OVERALL_ROADMAP.md` - See what's next
3. Read `PHASE_3_PRODUCTION_PLAN.md` - 6-week plan

## ✅ Quick Verification

After moving files, check:

```bash

# Should only have README.md + folders
ls docs/
```

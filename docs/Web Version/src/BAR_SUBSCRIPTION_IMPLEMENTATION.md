### 5. Documentation

  - Pricing table
  - Feature comparison
  - Use cases and examples
  - FAQ section
  - What's included in each package

- `/industries/bar/README.md` - Bar industry guide
  - Complete feature overview
  - Setup instructions
  - Compliance best practices
  - Bar-specific workflows
  - Hardware recommendations
  - Legal disclaimer

- `/industries/bar/FEATURE_COMPARISON.md` - Detailed comparison

- `/BAR_SUBSCRIPTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

### 6. Store Updates (`/lib/store.ts`)

**Changed Default Subscription:**
- Before: `subscribedPresets: ['ultimate']`
- After: `subscribedPresets: ['restaurant', 'bar']`

This demonstrates the multi-industry subscription model where users can subscribe to multiple packages.

## Subscription Model

### How It Works

**Single Industry:**
- Subscribe to one package: $59-$99/month
- Access all features for that industry

**Multiple Industries:**
- Subscribe to multiple packages
- Example: Restaurant + Bar = $158/month
- Each package adds its specific features

**Ultimate:**
- All industry packages included
- Plus: Multi-location, advanced analytics, API access
- $299/month (cheaper than subscribing individually to all)

### Access Control

The system uses `subscribedPresets` array in the store to manage access:

```typescript
subscribedPresets: ['restaurant', 'bar'] // User has both packages

hasPresetAccess: (presetId) => {
  return subscribedPresets.includes(presetId) || subscribedPresets.includes('ultimate');
}
```

Business profile selector only shows presets the user has access to.

## Design Decisions

### Why Separate Bar View?

**Speed & Efficiency:**
- Bars need FAST service - drinks in seconds, not minutes
- Fewer clicks to common actions
- Visual layout optimized for drink categories
- Quick drink builder for custom orders

**Different Workflow:**
- Bars have tabs, restaurants have tables
- Bars focus on individual drinks, restaurants on meals
- Bars need bottle service tracking
- Bar staff work standing at speed, not sitting

**Visual Optimization:**
- Larger touch targets for speed
- Category filters always visible
- Tabs front and center
- Section view shows entire bar at once

### Component Architecture

**Modular Design:**
- Each view is a separate component
- Can be used independently or together
- Easy to customize per bar needs
- Reusable across different bar layouts

**Progressive Enhancement:**
- Works without plugins (basic ordering)
- Better with age verification plugin
- Even better with open tabs plugin
- Best with split checks plugin

**Data-Driven:**
- Sections configurable via bar.config.ts
- Drink modifiers from config
- Product categories from existing products
- All mock data replaceable with real data

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

All bar components are responsive:

**Mobile (< 768px):**
- Single column layouts
- Stacked tabs instead of side-by-side
- Compact table cards
- Simplified section view
- Touch-optimized buttons

**Tablet (768px - 1024px):**
- 2-column grid for tabs
- 2-3 column drink grid
- Condensed section view
- Medium-sized touch targets

**Desktop (> 1024px):**
- 3-5 column drink grid
- 3-column tab grid
- Full floor plan view
- All features visible

---

## Color System

Each section has a distinct color for visual recognition:

| Section | Color | Hex | Use Case |
|---------|-------|-----|----------|
| Main Bar | Brown | `#8B4513` | Traditional bar color |
| High Tops | Gray | `#4A5568` | Neutral, modern |
| Lounge | Purple | `#805AD5` | Upscale, comfortable |
| Patio | Green | `#38A169` | Outdoor, fresh |
| VIP | Gold | `#D69E2E` | Premium, exclusive |

**Visual Indicators:**
- üü¢ Green dot = Available
- üî¥ Red dot = Occupied
- üîµ Blue dot = Reserved
- üç∑ Wine glass = Has open tab

---

## Performance Considerations

**Optimizations:**
- Virtual scrolling for large product lists (if needed)
- Debounced search to prevent lag
- Memoized filtered product calculations
- Lazy loading of tab details
- Real-time updates only for visible tabs

**State Management:**
- Zustand store for global state
- Local state for UI-only concerns
- Session storage for age verification
- No unnecessary re-renders

---

## Accessibility

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Tab between sections
- Arrow keys in drink grid
- Enter to select
- Escape to close dialogs

**Screen Readers:**
- Proper ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Status announcements for cart additions
- Table descriptions include status

**Visual:**
- High contrast mode support
- Large touch targets (min 44x44px)
- Color + icon + text (not color alone)
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements

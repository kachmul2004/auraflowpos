### 1. Dialog Component

    currentNotes: String,
    onDismiss: () -> Unit,
    onSaveNotes: (String) -> Unit
)
```

- Preserves existing notes

### 2. ShoppingCart Integration

```kotlin
// Added parameters
orderNotes: String = "",
onSaveNotes: (String) -> Unit = {},

// Added state
var showNotesDialog by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

// Button click
onClick = { showNotesDialog = true }
```

### 3. POSScreen State Management

```kotlin
// State
var orderNotes by remember { mutableStateOf("") }

// Pass to ShoppingCart
orderNotes = orderNotes,
onSaveNotes = { notes -> orderNotes = notes },

// Save with order
orderViewModel.createOrder(
    customerId = selectedCustomer?.id,
    paymentMethod = paymentMethod,
    amountPaid = amountReceived,
    notes = orderNotes // ← Saved!
)
```
